               Decorating a room is a fun and creative activity. A well-decorated room makes us feel happy and comfortable. We can decorate our rooms in simple ways to make them look beautiful and peaceful. <br><br>

First, we should clean the room. A clean room always looks better. We can remove things we don’t use and keep the room neat and tidy.<br><br>

Next, we can choose a nice color for the walls. Light colors like white, cream, or light blue make the room look bigger and brighter. We can also use wallpapers or wall stickers to add more beauty.<br><br>

Furniture should be arranged in a simple and useful way. A bed, table, and chair are enough for a bedroom. We should not keep too much furniture in a small room. It is important to leave space to walk and move around easily.<br><br>

Adding curtains, bedsheets, and pillows with matching colors can make the room look lovely. We can also hang pictures, paintings, or photo frames on the walls. A small mirror can also make the room look stylish.<br><br>

Plants are a great way to decorate rooms. Small indoor plants give fresh air and add a natural look. We can also use soft lights or fairy lights to make the room look cozy in the evening.<br><br>

In the end, we should keep the room clean and organized. A decorated room gives us peace and helps us feel relaxed and happy.<br><br>
